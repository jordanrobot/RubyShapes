  FIXME: finish implimenting the ShapeUtils::corner_radius method
        -as of now it calculates when thickness is a gauge, not a decimal
  FIXME: Rectangular tubing accuracy is off just a little bit?
          -precision in the millionths seems to be off - determine where it is failing
          -seems to be affecting I, S, & R values (check others)
  FIXME: Fix rectangular tubing math (IT IS BROKEN) & verify
  FIXME: Bar class returns odd I values to bar.props, alo S & R are broken
  FIXME: Fix bar math & verify - only guestimates

TODO
=begin

  TODO: create ShapeUtils::pipe_converter method, same as gauge_converter, based on schedule system
  TODO: Create testing method/module/mixin to verify math and return a pass/fail
        -Manually enter several accurate results (through range of sizes) w/ corresponding inputs?
        -Check that calculations == accurate results
        -Give a prelim pass/fail based on results
  TODO: hand calculate some of the properties and see if the float values fudge accuracy
  TODO: examine standardizing all return values from every class?
        -this would allow several methods to move from Shape specific classes to the ShapeUtils module
        -Hash, BigHash
  TODO: Merge Rec_tubing and Square_tubing class?
