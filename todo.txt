  TODO: Fix the corner radius decision tree
  TODO: create ShapeUtils::pipe_converter method, same as gauge_converter, based on schedule system
  TODO: create ShapeUtils::corner_radius method to automatically determine radius of corners
        -method:
          -use a case table to find the radius that is correct for the thickness and perimeter
          -save the result to the @ra variable
        -remove ra variable from ShapeClass.new invocation 
  TODO: Create testing method/module/mixin to verify math and return a pass/fail
        -Manually enter several accurate results (through range of sizes) w/ corresponding inputs?
        -Check that calculations == accurate results
        -Give a prelim pass/fail based on results
  TODO: hand calculate some of the properties and see if the float values fudge accuracy
  TODO: examine standardizing all return values from every class?
        -this would allow several methods to move from Shape specific classes to the ShapeUtils module
        -Hash, BigHash
  TODO: Merge Rec_tubing and Square_tubing class?

  FIXME: Rectangular tubing accuracy is off just a little bit?
          -precision in the millionths seems to be off - determine where it is failing
          -seems to be affecting I, S, & R values (check others)
  FIXME: Fix rectangular tubing math (IT IS BROKEN) & verify
  FIXME: Bar class returns odd I values to bar.props, alo S & R are broken
  FIXME: Fix bar math & verify - only guestimates


== Version History ==

v 0.2.6 - current
    VERIFIED: Round tube calculations are accurate! 
    ADDED: ShapeUtils:gauge_converter now pulls values from a $gauge_factors hash
    ADDED: Diagnostic label system, uses an 'if DIAGNOSTICS = "on"' test to determine whether to print or not
    TODO: Fix the corner radius decision tree

v 0.2.5.4
    ADDED: Added round bar stuff - math has not been verified
    ADDED: Diagnostic flag - $diagnostics (on/off)
    ADDED: Diagnostic methods & such, .label

v 0.2.5.3
    ADDED: new file - todo.txt (this file) - migrated contents from shapes.rb
    ADDED: more values to gauge_converter. Now includes 0000ga. through 30ga.
    RENAMED: ShapeUtils::test_vars to ShapeUtils::var_classes
    FIXED: var_classes code
    ADDED: ShapeUtils::var_values

v 0.2.5.2
    ADDED: add ability to use gauges as input arguments as well as decimal thicknesses uses the Printer.gauge_converter method

v 0.2.5
    ADDED: let attributes be entered without trailing zeros & a decimal point
