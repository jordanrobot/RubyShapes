  CONSIDER: revising structure? Separate classes into:
	- solid shapes
	- "theoretical" hollow shapes
	- mechanical tubing shapes
	- hollow structural shapes - already implimented in a handy excel file from AISC
	- nominal pipe size shapes
	- maybe, someday, structural beams (I, C, Z...) - already implimented in a handy excel file from AISC, complicated! woot.

  FIXME: Rectangular tubing accuracy is off just a little bit?
        -precision in the millionths seems to be off
		-the trouble starts in the I calculation, steamrolls through S, & R values.
		-tested formula in Mathematica, it corresponds to the ruby output.  the problem seems to lie in which corner radius is specified in the calculations.  Since the corner radius for any given tubing is listed as a range of values, I don't know which ones the Steel Tube Institute used!  Bastards.

  FIXME: Bar class returns odd I values to bar.props, steamrolls to S & R properties

  VERIFY: Bar math - only guesstimates

  ADD: Add radius of gyration variable?
  ADD: Add extreme fiber distance variable?
  ADD: Create add_hash method using new standardized variables?


  TODO: Replace DiagUtils Module for a real diagnostic & debugging library.
  TODO: create ShapeUtils::pipe_converter method, same as gauge_converter, based on schedule system
  TODO: Create testing method/module/mixin to verify math and return a pass/fail
        -Manually enter several accurate results (through range of sizes) w/ corresponding inputs?
        -Check that calculations == accurate results
        -Give a prelim pass/fail based on results
  TODO: hand calculate some of the properties and see if the float values fudge accuracy
  TODO: Merge Rec_tubing and Square_tubing class? - (using calcs from rec_tubing class)
